# JNDSLAM
A method for automatic pitch contour stylisation

This version 0.01 features:

A simple method for stylising pitch contours based on the Just Noticeable Difference in pitch.

NOTE! This is incomplete! LOWESS smoothing is not yet implemented so the output is incorrect.

To use:

Unpack the tar.gz file and then the normal ./configure && make && make install should work.

I recommend just ./configure && make and then running from the src dir.

Any issues please mail rasmus@dall.dk
